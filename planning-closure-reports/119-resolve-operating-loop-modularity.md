# Planning Closure Report

## Plain Summary

Codex has current, reviewed planning evidence for this task. No code was changed by this check; the next layer must revalidate before any write.

## Current Task

- Task ref: `task:8076c2a8a25ff7cf3510a05e8fe5654511690bc16aa43429a0b680daf0643630`
- Intent digest: `sha256:7c2e387d1e68deeaa956cdd690e69b3965d294aa1e7b4f65e4933002da307e4c`
- Task impact: `HIGH`
- Current task match: `Yes`

## Required Planning Sources

| Source | Required | Validation | State | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BUSINESS_UNIVERSE` | `Yes` | `VALID` | `COVERAGE_READY` | The source passed its strict checker and is ready. |
| `BUSINESS_RULE` | `Yes` | `VALID` | `READY_FOR_IMPACT_COVERAGE` | The source passed its strict checker and is ready. |
| `CHANGE_IMPACT` | `Yes` | `VALID` | `CHANGE_IMPACT_RECORDED` | The source passed its strict checker and is ready. |
| `VERIFICATION_PLAN` | `Yes` | `VALID` | `VERIFICATION_PLAN_READY` | The source passed its strict checker and is ready. |
| `PLAN_REVIEW` | `Yes` | `VALID` | `PLAN_REVIEW_PASSED` | The source passed its strict checker and is ready. |
| `CONTROL_EFFECTIVENESS` | `Yes` | `VALID` | `CONTROL_PROVEN_EFFECTIVE` | The source passed its strict checker and is ready. |

## First Blocker And Next Step

- Code: `NONE`
- Responsibility: `NONE`
- Reason: Every required planning source is current and ready.
- Next step: Codex may continue to controlled implementation review after pre-write revalidation.

## Execution Entry Contract

`execution-entry:task-8076c2a8a25ff7cf3510a05e8fe5654511690bc16aa43429a0b680daf0643630` is available as a non-authorizing handoff. All mutable authority fields remain `No`.

## Boundaries

This report changes no task state and authorizes no implementation, project
write, apply, release, production, or completion claim.
